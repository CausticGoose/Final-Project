# Final-Project
The final project that I wrote for UChicago's CMSC 25910

This is not an extremely refined project though I hope it can illustrate some of my proficency with libraries like numpy, pandas, pytorch, sklearn, kgboost, and pyplot. It's roughly representitive of what I can do in one workday. 

The written report that I submitted to my class can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1efB-q5h2aWsTsm7ylK6mZlqA0aJw1FD2P058jBBPDCA/edit?usp=sharing
